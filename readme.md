# Sequence Interference Experiment

The experiment was designed to observe the effect of sequence change after a certain digit while executing a highly practiced sequence (causing conflict between memory and visual input). Based on previous studies, tries to answer how long it takes for the memory of the learned sequence to shut off. Moving window size was used as our independent variable. The window size was either 2, 3, 4, 11. The length of sequences were 11.  

Participants were divided into two groups. They performed three sessions, one for training, and two for test. Each session comprised of a pre and a post block to check for the persistence of sequence speicifc learning (testing on train vs untrained on those blocks). 

In the first session, participants were trained on specific sequences for six blocks. Each block had 32 trials. 

In the next two sessions, each consisting of ten blocks, sometimes randomly all the subsequence digits after a certain digit would change randomly to a new one. The location of the start of that change is at either locations 5, 7, or 9. The probability of this purturbation for a trial consisting of a learned sequence happening was 1 to 2. Each of the blocks had 30 trials. 2/5 of trials were random sequences, 2/5 unchanged trained sequences, and 1/5 changed trained sequences. Particiapnts were asked to perform better than 85% accuracy. 

There was a precue time of 0 ms, ITI of 3000ms.
